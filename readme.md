# Heartbeat Visualization Project

Welcome to the Heartbeat Visualization project! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a fun and interactive way to visualize the beat of noises captured by your microphone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project utilizes the `getUserMedia` API to access your microphone and capture audio input. The captured audio is then processed in real-time using the Web Audio API to analyze its frequency components. Based on the frequency data, a heart-shaped element on the webpage pulsates and scales dynamically, syncing with the beat of the captured noises.

## Features

- **Real-time Audio Analysis**: The project analyzes the frequency components of the audio captured by your microphone in real-time.
- **Dynamic Heartbeat Animation**: A heart-shaped element on the webpage pulsates and scales dynamically, reflecting the intensity and rhythm of the captured noises.

## Setup Instructions

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. Allow the browser to access your microphone when prompted.

5. Enjoy the interactive heartbeat visualization as you make noises or play music!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage and define the heart-shaped element.
- **CSS**: Used to style the heart element and create visual effects.
- **JavaScript**: Used to access the microphone, process audio input, and dynamically update the heartbeat animation.
